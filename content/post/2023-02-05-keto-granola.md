Several years ago my doctor diagnosed me with pre-diabetes with insulin resistance.  At first, I didn't take it very seriously and continued with the carb binges.  I don't even want to think about how many carbs I was consuming on a daily basis.  Of course, along with the carbs came the high spikes and low crashes in blood sugar.  I remember just wanting to nap every day after lunch.  Finally, my doctor told me that if I didn't start taking it seriously, I was a prime candidate for heart attack and stroke and that insulin resistance and blood sugar issues were a common factor that they see in people who die from those issues.

With that, I decided it was time to do something about it.  That's when I began the Keto way of life.  I was Keto for just over a year and as I had blood work done throughout that time, we noticed my numbers started coming down.  Well, I'm pleased to report that with my last blood work, all four of the indicators my doctor looks at to determine pre-diabetes were well within range.  I think that's the first time my insulin has been in range in more than 10 years.

However, Keto isn't my doctor's favorite way of life.  She believes that these numbers can be kept in check through a careful and clean diet of fish, lean meats, nuts, berries, vegetables, etc. Basically, if you can grow it, shoot it, or catch it, you can eat it.  It's sort of a modified mediterranean diet.  Another way she put it that hit home for me was, if Jesus ate it, you can eat it. I'm just hoping Jesus occasionally had pizza!  So bottom line, eating about 15-30 carbs per meal with two fruits per day is what she suggests.  In addition, in order for me to keep my numbers in check and ensure I know what foods may impact my blood glucose levels, my doctor prescribed me the Freestyle Libre 3 continuous blood glucose monitor and it has been amazing.

Now, on to our topic of this post.  One of the things I truly missed on the Keto diet was a nice, big bowl of cereal. It's a comfort food. I have purchased the Keto cereals in the grocery store in the past.  Some were ok, but most fell flat for me.  They just didn't satisfy that craving and didn't have the flavor I was hoping to get from cereal.  Many tasted like cardboard.  So one day my wife came home from Sam's Club with a big bag of ["NuTrail Keto Granola Crunch"](https://nutrail.com/) in a Limited Edition Chocolate Cupcake flavor.  Now the first thing I did was to add the recommended serving size of 1/3 cup to some of the [:ratio brand Keto Yogurt](https://ratiofood.com/collections/keto-dairy-snacks).  With the granola and yogurt being only 2 net carbs each, that was a great snack at only 4 net carbs and it tasted delicious.

So, one night around dinner time, I just wasn't that hungry and couldn't find anything I really thought I wanted to eat and then it hit me.  I wonder if the Keto Granola would work as a cereal?  Would it hold up in milk and keep it's crunch?  Would it taste good as a cereal and not in yogurt?  So I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a try.  Let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations.  It was amazing and I'm so happy to have a keto or low carb cereal option that truly tastes like you would expect a cereal to taste.  It checked every box for me.  Oh, and do you want to know the best part?  No spike or change in my blood sugar, based on my monitor.  Here is what I did:
