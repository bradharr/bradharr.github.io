![Homemade Crunchy Peanut Butter](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/10/15/07/36/peanut-butter-2852462_1280.jpg)

## Ingredients

- 8 cups unsalted dry roasted peanuts  
- 1 tsp mineral salt (adjust to taste)  
- 1/4 tsp pure organic stevia leaf extract powder  
- 1/2 tsp molasses  
- 2–3 tbsp peanut oil (start with 2, add more if needed)  
- 2/3 cup chopped peanuts (for crunch)  

## Instructions

1. Set aside chopped peanuts for mix-in.  
2. In batches, blend the 8 cups of peanuts in your Vitamix. Don’t overload it — use 2–3 batches if needed.  
3. Blend each batch until creamy, scraping down sides as needed.  
4. Combine all batches into a bowl. Add salt, stevia, molasses, and peanut oil. Stir well or do one last blend for consistency.  
5. Fold in chopped peanuts by hand to preserve the crunch.  
6. Taste and adjust seasoning: more salt, a little more molasses, or oil if needed.  
7. Transfer to jars. This recipe makes about 4 cups (1 quart) of peanut butter.  

## Notes

- Peanut oil gives the best flavor and texture — don’t substitute with water or olive oil.  
- Store in airtight container. Natural oil separation is normal — stir before use.  
- Refrigerate for longer shelf life, but it spreads best at room temp.  
- Taste improves over a day or two as flavors mellow.
