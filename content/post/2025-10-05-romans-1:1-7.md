# Sermon Title: Romans 1:1–7
## Passage: Romans 1:1–7
### Key Theme:
Paul introduces himself and the Gospel of Jesus Christ, establishing his divine calling as an apostle and the foundation of salvation by grace through faith. God sets His people apart for the purpose of proclaiming the Gospel and living in obedience to the faith.

### Summary:
In this introduction to Romans, Paul opens his letter by identifying himself as a *bond-servant* and *apostle* of Jesus Christ—called and set apart for the Gospel. Though once a Pharisee and persecutor of Christians, Paul’s life was radically transformed by his encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus. Writing from his third missionary journey, he addresses believers in Rome with the doctrinal foundation needed for a spiritually mature, unified church built upon righteousness through faith.

Paul emphasizes that the Gospel he preaches is not new but foretold through the prophets, fulfilled in Jesus Christ—the Son of God, confirmed by the resurrection, and witnessed by over 500 people. Through Christ, believers receive both grace and apostleship to bring about obedience of faith among all nations for His name’s sake. Paul reminds us that every believer is called, forgiven, and set apart to live for the purpose of advancing the Kingdom, not for spiritual complacency.

Romans, written under the shadow of Nero’s growing persecution, urges believers to stand firm in truth, to live righteously in a corrupt world, and to be bold in faith despite opposition. True love bears truth, not deception, and peace is found only when we surrender to God’s wisdom and authority.

### Key Points:
1. **Paul’s Identity and Calling**  
   - Paul identifies as a *bond-servant*—a willing slave of Christ who joyfully submits to His authority.  
   - He is also an *apostle*—a messenger sent by God to proclaim the Gospel.  
   - His transformation from persecutor to preacher demonstrates the power of grace.  

2. **Set Apart for the Gospel**  
   - Believers are not only called to be holy but also *set apart for a purpose*—to proclaim the Gospel and advance God’s Kingdom.  
   - Sanctification is not stagnation; spiritual maturity leads to service and obedience.  
   - The Gospel Paul preaches is the fulfillment of God’s eternal promise, not a new doctrine.

3. **Grace, Faith, and Obedience**  
   - Through Christ, we receive *grace* and the *call to obedience of faith* among all nations.  
   - Salvation comes by faith alone—righteousness is imputed through belief, not works.  
   - The believer’s life must reflect submission to Christ and participation in His mission.  

### Application:
As believers, we are called not just to *know* the Word but to *live* it. Paul reminds us that being set apart means living purposefully—serving, proclaiming, and walking in faith. We must evaluate whether our lives bear the mark of a true bond-servant of Christ: humble, obedient, and dedicated to the spread of the Gospel.  

In a world that often twists or rejects biblical truth, we must remain steadfast in sound doctrine, walking in the freedom and peace that come from obedience to God’s Word. Let us pray for the boldness to stand for our faith even when the world is hostile toward it.

### Scripture to Remember:
> “Through Him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name’s sake.”  
> — **Romans 1:5**
