# Sermon Title: Romans 1:8–15
## Passage: Romans 1:8–15 (NKJV)
### Key Theme:
Faith flourishes on the gospel’s basics and matures through the Spirit’s work and sound doctrine; Paul models grateful prayer, mutual encouragement, and readiness to preach.

### Summary:
Paul thanks God that the Roman believers’ faith is widely known. He continually prays for them and longs to visit—not as a celebrity, but as a fellow disciple eager to strengthen and be strengthened by their mutual faith. He has often planned to come but was providentially hindered. As a debtor to all peoples, Paul is ready to preach the gospel in Rome, emphasizing that strong churches grow by the Word, the Spirit, and obedience—not by legalism or mere hype.

### Key Points:
1. **Grateful Intercession:** Paul’s ministry begins with thanksgiving and persistent prayer (vv. 8–10).
2. **Mutual Encouragement:** Gifts strengthen the church so that both leaders and saints are established together (vv. 11–12).
3. **Ready to Preach:** Hindrances don’t cancel calling; Paul lives as a debtor to all and stands ready to bring the gospel in Rome (vv. 13–15).

### Application:
- Pray for your church by name this week—thank God for evidences of faith and ask Him to establish believers in truth.  
- Seek mutual encouragement: share one concrete testimony and ask one honest question in your small group.  
- Live as a “debtor to all”: identify one person (neighbor, coworker, classmate) and purpose to share the gospel simply and clearly.

### Scripture to Remember:
“So, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.” (Romans 1:15, NKJV)
