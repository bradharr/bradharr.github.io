# Sermon Title: True Worshipers Sacrifice Tithes & Offerings
## Passage:
Ephesians 4:11-16

### Key Theme:
True worship flows from Spirit and truth and is expressed in tangible obedience—notably through tithes and offerings given from firstfruits. God completed the once‑for‑all sacrifice in Christ; our giving is not atonement but worship that acknowledges His sovereignty, faithfulness, and worthiness, and it fuels ministry and care for the body.

### Summary:
Paul frames Christian maturity in Ephesians 4:11–16: Christ supplies leaders to equip the saints so the whole body grows up into Him, no longer tossed by every new idea but speaking the truth in love. That maturity shows up in worship that is both spiritual and truthful (John 4:19–24). Worship is bigger than music; it is the whole‑life bowing of self before God in reverent devotion.

From Genesis onward, giving has been one of the believer’s core expressions of worship. Cain and Abel knew God desired particular offerings (Genesis 4:2–7) long before the Law specified them. The Law later clarified what God desired for a growing nation: firstfruits, tithes that sustained Levites and temple work, regular care for the poor, and special offerings for God’s dwelling (Leviticus 27:30; Numbers 18:21–28; Deuteronomy 12; 14). Sacrifice itself pointed to Christ—the spotless Lamb whose once‑for‑all offering finished atonement (Exodus 12:5; 1 Peter 1:19; Hebrews 10:9–10). Because Christ’s sacrifice is complete, our giving is not to buy favor but to say, “Thank You,” with the first and best of what He provides.

In the New Testament church, that pattern continues. Believers met needs extravagantly (Acts 4:34–35), and the Lord commanded that those who preach the gospel live from the gospel (1 Corinthians 9:13–14). Paul insists giving be willing and cheerful—never coerced, never grudging (2 Corinthians 8:8; 9:6–7). God rejects empty ritual from hard hearts (Amos 5; Isaiah 1; Hosea 6; Psalm 51). True giving springs from love, gratitude, and trust.

Practically, firstfruits means we honor God from the whole of His provision—before taxes, before benefits, before the budget shuffles us into leftovers. For some, obedience requires first untangling debt and learning contentment. For others, offerings of time and skill are an additional (not replacement) way to worship—brewing the coffee, setting chairs, cleaning, serving the least. When a church family worships this way, pastors are sustained, widows and orphans are cared for, and the church becomes a community that lacks nothing, even in lean times. The question isn’t “Is it required by the Law?” but “Is Christ receiving my first and my best?”

### Key Points:
1. Christ gave leaders to equip the saints so every part ‘does its share’ and the body grows (Eph. 4:11–16).
2. Worship is whole‑life devotion in Spirit and truth; music is one expression, not the whole.
3. Giving predates the Law (Genesis 4) and is clarified by it; sacrifice points to Christ’s finished work.
4. Tithes (first tenth) and offerings are worship, not atonement; they acknowledge God’s rule and provision.
5. New Testament continuity: needs met through the church; ministers live from the gospel; giving must be cheerful, not coerced.
6. Firstfruits means the first and best of God’s provision—not leftovers; offerings add to, not replace, the tithe.
7. Healthy worship funds ministry and mercy so the church can care for pastors, widows, orphans, and mission.

### Application:
Prayerfully inventory God’s provision and define your true firstfruits. Set a plan to honor God first—and address debts that keep you from obedience. If finances are tight, begin faithfully with proportionate giving, and add offerings of time and skill. Guard your heart: give cheerfully, in gratitude, trusting the Father to provide. Disciple your household in these rhythms so worship in Spirit and truth becomes a family habit.

### Scripture to Remember: 
Ephesians 4:15 (NKJV) — “but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ—”
