## Passage: Romans 1:16–17

***

## Key Theme:
The Gospel is the power of God for salvation and the ongoing life of the believer. Christ’s finished work—His sinless life, willing death, and victorious resurrection—reveals God’s righteousness and frees us to live unashamed, Spirit-filled, and faithful.

***

## Summary:
Paul declares that he is **not ashamed of the gospel** because it is **the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes** (**Romans 1:16–17**)¹. Christians should own this truth with holy boldness: we are not better than others, but we are called to a better, holy way of life because the Holy Spirit dwells in us.

The Gospel itself is the good news of **Jesus Christ—His perfect life, His willing death for sinners, and His bodily resurrection**. Because Jesus is alive, He both saves and sustains. To be ashamed of the Gospel is to doubt the sufficiency of Christ’s work, to fear the evaluation of the world more than the judgment of God, or to act as though opposing powers are stronger than Jesus. Paul refuses this posture because the Gospel carries God’s **inherent, dynamic power (dunamis)**, and that same power fills believers through the Holy Spirit so that we lack nothing.

God’s saving intent is **universal**—salvation is offered to all, though not all receive it. The phrase “for the Jew first and also for the Greek” reflects divine order, not superiority. Salvation is now a **spiritual work of the heart**, not a work of the Law, because the legal demands of righteousness were **nailed to the cross** (**Colossians 2:11–15**)². In the Gospel, the **righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith**—it saves, heals, and restores, producing a living testimony among believers.

Believers should be ready with a clear Gospel testimony: who you were, how you died with Christ, and how you were raised new in Him. Focus on newness of life, not on glorifying the past. **“The just shall live by faith”** means we trust not in ourselves, but in the power of God present within us. We run first to Scripture, to prayer, and to the Spirit’s help; other aids can support faith, but they must never replace it.

***

## Key Points:
1. **Live unashamed**: the Gospel is God’s power to save everyone who believes (**Romans 1:16–17**)¹.  
2. **The Gospel = Jesus’ perfect life, willing death, and bodily resurrection** — He is alive and able to save.  
3. **Shame** doubts Christ’s sufficiency and fears man’s opinion; **faith** rests in God’s power (dunamis) at work in us.  
4. **Salvation is offered to all** — “to the Jew first and also to the Greek” shows order, not superiority.  
5. **Christ ended legalistic boasting** — circumcision is of the heart; our debts were nailed to the cross (**Colossians 2:11–15**)².  
6. **God’s righteousness is revealed from faith to faith** — the Gospel also heals and makes lives whole.  
7. **Bear a concise Gospel testimony**: before Christ → death to self → raised new in Christ; emphasize new life.  
8. **The just shall live by faith** — seek Scripture, prayer, and the Spirit first; other helps support, not replace, faith.

***

## Application:
Refuse shame. Pray for boldness to confess Christ publicly and to lean on Scripture first in counsel and crisis. Prepare a two-minute Gospel testimony that highlights your new life in Christ. Entrust lingering legalism or guilt to the cross, and practice daily reliance on the Holy Spirit’s power rather than human approval.

## Scripture to Remember:
> **Romans 1:16 (NKJV)** — “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.”
