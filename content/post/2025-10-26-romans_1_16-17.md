# Sermon Title: Romans 1:16–17
## Passage: Romans 1:16-17

### Key Theme:
The Gospel is the power of God for salvation and the ongoing life of the believer. Christ’s finished work—His sinless life, willing death, and victorious resurrection—reveals God’s righteousness and frees us to live unashamed, Spirit-filled, and faithful.

### Summary:
Paul announces that he is not ashamed of the Gospel because it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. The church should own this with holy confidence: Christians are not better people, but they are called to a better, holy way of life because the Holy Spirit dwells in them.

The Gospel itself is the good news of Jesus Christ—His perfect life, His willing death for sinners, and His bodily resurrection. Because Jesus is alive, He saves and sustains. To be ashamed of the Gospel is to doubt the validity or sufficiency of Christ’s work, to fear the evaluation of the world more than the judgment of God, or to treat opposing powers as stronger than Jesus. Paul pushes back: the Gospel carries God’s inherent power (dunamis), and the Spirit fills believers with that same power so they lack nothing.

God’s saving intent is universal in scope—salvation is offered to all, though not all receive it. The pattern of revelation (to the Jew first, then to the Gentile) shows continuity in God’s plan, not superiority of salvation. In Christ, salvation is no longer a work of the Law but a spiritual work of the heart (Colossians 2:11–15): legalistic righteousness was nailed to the cross. In the Gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed “from faith to faith”—the message saves and also heals, restoring broken lives and producing a living testimony in the church.

Believers should be ready with a clear testimony: who you were, how you died with Christ, and how you were raised new in Him. Focus on newness of life, not glorifying the past. The just shall live by faith—so we claim, not in ourselves, but in the power of God present in us. Run first to Scripture, prayer, and the Spirit’s help; other helps support faith but must not replace it.

### Key Points:
1. Live unashamed: the Gospel is God’s power to save everyone who believes (Romans 1:16).
2. The Gospel = Jesus’ perfect life, willing death, and bodily resurrection; He is alive and able to save.
3. Shame doubts Christ’s sufficiency and fears man’s opinion; faith rests in God’s power (dunamis) at work in us.
4. Salvation is offered to all; “to the Jew first and also to the Greek” shows order, not superiority.
5. Christ ended legalistic boasting—circumcision is of the heart; our debts were nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:11–15).
6. God’s righteousness is revealed from faith to faith; the Gospel also heals and makes lives whole.
7. Bear a concise Gospel testimony: before Christ → death to self → raised new in Christ; emphasize new life.
8. The just shall live by faith—seek Scripture, prayer, and the Spirit first; other helps support, not replace, faith.

### Application:
Refuse shame. Pray for boldness to confess Christ publicly and to lean on Scripture first in counsel and crisis. Prepare a two-minute Gospel testimony that highlights your new life in Christ. Entrust lingering legalism or guilt to the cross, and practice daily reliance on the Spirit’s power rather than human approval.

### Scripture to Remember: 
Romans 1:16 (NKJV) — “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.”
