## Passage: Romans 1:18–32

***

## Key Theme:
God’s wrath is not arbitrary or impulsive; it is His righteous response to sin and the willful suppression of His truth. Those who reject Him experience separation from His presence and are given over to their own desires, while those who live by faith experience His power and righteousness.

***

## Summary:
Paul reveals that the **wrath of God is revealed from heaven** against all who suppress the truth in unrighteousness (**Romans 1:18–32**)¹. The difference between the believer and unbeliever is stark: believers experience the **power of God**, while unbelievers experience the **wrath of God**. 

This passage explains that God’s wrath is not always expressed through catastrophic events—it is often revealed as His withdrawal, allowing mankind to chase after sin’s destruction. Those who reject God’s truth choose moral decay. In doing so, they exchange the truth of God for a lie and worship creation rather than the Creator.

Even though all men are aware of God—His invisible attributes and divine nature are clearly seen—many deliberately suppress this truth. Scripture declares that **every man is aware of God**, leaving no room for atheism; the issue is not ignorance but rebellion. By elevating self and worshiping human wisdom or creation, mankind descends further into darkness.

Paul identifies a progression of rebellion: **God gave them up** to uncleanness, vile passions, and a debased mind. This is not the explosive wrath of destruction, but the dreadful wrath of abandonment—God allowing man to have what he desires. The result is moral and spiritual decay, expressed in pride, immorality, and approval of evil. 

As believers, we are called to live differently. To reject truth or to approve of unrighteousness is to align with the rebellion of the world. Our call is to stand firm in truth, share the Gospel in love, and contend for those lost in deception.

***

## Key Points:
1. God’s wrath is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness (**Romans 1:18–32**)¹.  
2. Suppressing truth provokes wrath; accepting truth brings salvation.  
3. Every person is aware of God’s existence—His attributes are seen in creation.  
4. Atheism and evolution suppress truth by denying the Creator.  
5. God’s wrath allows man to pursue sin’s path to destruction.  
6. To approve of sin is to share in its guilt.  
7. Believers must contend for truth, lovingly pointing others to repentance in Christ.  
8. God’s power redeems and restores those who turn to Him by faith.  

***

## Application:
Rejecting truth leads to wrath; receiving truth leads to life. Examine whether your choices reflect submission to God or rebellion against Him. Be bold in defending biblical truth with love. Pray for the lost, contend for your children’s hearts, and let your life demonstrate that God is real and His Word is truth.

## Scripture to Remember:
> **Romans 1:18 (NKJV)** — “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.”
