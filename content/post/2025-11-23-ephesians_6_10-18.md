## Passage: Ephesians 6:10–18

***

## Key Theme:
Believers are engaged in a very real spiritual battle. God equips His people to stand firm—not in their own strength, but **in the power of the Lord**. Paul calls every Christian to recognize the reality of spiritual warfare, discern the true enemy, and take up the full armor of God.

***

## Summary:
Pastor Gary emphasizes that Paul uses three spiritual “postures” throughout Ephesians—**sit**, **walk**, and **stand**—and each describes a dimension of the Christian life. We are **seated with Christ** in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6), we are to **walk worthy** of Christ (Ephesians 4–5), and finally we must **stand** in the power of Christ (Ephesians 6:10–18). That final posture—standing—signals the seriousness of the spiritual war every believer faces.

This battle is unseen but very real. Scripture teaches that Satan is not simply a symbol of evil, but a real spiritual entity bent on destroying marriages, families, churches, and lives. Surveys indicate that more than half of Americans believe Satan is real, yet far fewer understand how to defend themselves spiritually. Spiritual warfare involves unseen demonic forces that tempt, lie, deceive, discourage, confuse, and harm. Satan is described variously as a liar, a murderer, a serpent, a dragon, a deceiver, and a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. He especially targets believers who are actively living for the Lord, because they are a threat to his agenda.

The origin of these forces goes back to Satan’s rebellion against God, when he and one-third of the angels were cast out of heaven (Revelation 12:4⁽¹⁾, 7–9⁽¹⁾; Isaiah 14:12⁽²⁾; Luke 10:18⁽³⁾). These fallen angels—demons—now operate in the unseen realm. While Christians cannot be **possessed** (the Holy Spirit does not share residence), they can be **oppressed**, harassed, and wearied by spiritual attack. Demons can whisper lies, stir division, exploit fear, influence emotions, and even impact believers physically.

Paul urges the church to recognize the true enemy. People are not our adversaries—**we wrestle not against flesh and blood**. The real enemy is the hierarchy of spiritual wickedness: principalities, powers, rulers of darkness, and spiritual hosts of wickedness in heavenly places (Ephesians 6:12). Believers are not called to retreat, but to stand firm—again and again, Paul repeats this command.

To stand strong, Christians must find their strength in the Lord, not themselves. Even Michael the archangel did not rebuke Satan in his own authority (Jude 9⁽⁴⁾). Paul then describes the full armor of God, which protects every part of the believer’s life—heart, mind, walk, faith, identity, and spirit.

The armor includes:  
• **The Belt of Truth** – anchoring us in God’s Word.  
• **The Breastplate of Righteousness** – keeping our hearts aligned with God.  
• **The Gospel of Peace on our feet** – carrying Christ’s message wherever we go.  
• **The Shield of Faith** – extinguishing the enemy’s fiery darts of fear (2 Timothy 1:7⁽⁵⁾).  
• **The Helmet of Salvation** – guarding our minds and identity in Christ.  
• **The Sword of the Spirit** – the Word of God, our offensive weapon.  
• **Praying always** – the posture of continual dependence.

When believers stand firm—submitted to God and resisting the devil—Satan will flee. But believers must reject passivity, awaken from discouragement, and stand their ground for their families, marriages, faith, and churches.

## Key Points:
1. The believer’s spiritual posture is threefold: **seated**, **walking**, and **standing**.  
2. Spiritual warfare is real and Satan targets believers who impact the Kingdom of God.  
3. We must recognize the true enemy—**not people**, but spiritual forces of darkness (Ephesians 6:12)⁶.  
4. Christians cannot be demon-possessed, but can be oppressed.  
5. The armor of God protects every dimension of life—heart, mind, walk, faith, and spirit.  
6. Faith extinguishes fear; Scripture is our sword; prayer is our continual lifeline.  
7. Believers must not retreat—**stand your ground in the Lord’s strength**.  

***

## Application:
Stand your ground in Christ. Refuse to live in fear or confusion. Strengthen yourself in Scripture, prayer, and fellowship. Put on the full armor of God daily and remember that your fight is not against people but against spiritual forces. Arm yourself with truth, righteousness, faith, and the Word. Pray persistently and contend spiritually for your marriage, your children, your family, your church, and those who are weary and under attack.

## Scripture to Remember:
> **Ephesians 6:11 (NKJV)** — “Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”
